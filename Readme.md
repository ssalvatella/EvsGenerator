# EVs Generator
Small program in Java that generates an XML file that describes the electric
 vehicle models to use in a simulation of [ns-3 with electric vehicle consumption model](https://github.com/ssalvatella/ns-3-mobility-consumption/tree/master).

You only have to indicate in the file `electricVehicles.properties` the number of nodes
 that you want for each model.
 
 The electric vehicle models available at the moment are:
 
    * Leaf
    * Zoe
    * i3
    * eGolf
    * Model S
